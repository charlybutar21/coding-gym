# S.O.L.I.D Principles

SOLID is an acronym that summarizes five design principles in object-oriented programming. These principles help developers create code that is easier to understand, manage, and maintain in the future. Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation:
### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Every class should have only one responsibility. This ensures that each class focuses on a specific aspect of the system.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (like classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, OCP suggests that when we can add new features or extend functionality, but we don't need to modify existing code; instead.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Software entities (like classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, OCP ensures that when we add new features or extend functionality, we don't need to modify existing code; instead, we can add new extensions.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. ISP helps reduce dependencies on large and non-specific interfaces by encouraging smaller, more focused interfaces. This ensures that each client only uses the methods they actually need, making the code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This principle recommends that classes should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
